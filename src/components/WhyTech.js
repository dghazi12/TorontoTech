        <p>Our world is increasingly driven by technology -- it's all around us,
            and it changes how we interact with the world and each other. Technical
            literacy is widely considered one of the most important 21st century skills,
            and it is a passport into participation in the modern economy. Tech skills
            are consistently one of the most in- demand skill sets.
        </p>
